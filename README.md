# belly-button-challenge
We are building an interactive dashboard to explore the "Belly Button Biodiversity dataset" which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare

This work was done with the help of my classmate, Tobe, with some help from a tutor, and one of our TA. We also used Google and Xpert learning to help correct our coding.
